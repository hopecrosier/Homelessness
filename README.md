# Homelessness - Introduction
The purpose of this project is to determine if homelessness can be predicted by local housing market factors. We will focus on market predictors of homelessness and Continuums of Care (CoC) to help get a sense of observations regarding both homelessness and market state in different categories.

## Data
Our data comes from The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and their report "Market Predictors of Homelessness" which can be found here: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/Market-Predictors-of-Homelessness.pdf
It contains data regarding the number of homeless people, along with geographic, demographic and economic factors, which can be found in the files under the Data folder

## Data Preperation
We wanted to prepare our data for future analysis by inspecting the columns/variables given to us in our original data, checking for sufficient data for a quality analysis, scaling down number of variables, inspecting the dictionary to make sense of what the variables we're keeping are, and converting totals to rates. The code for this data preperation can be found in the Notebooks folder in the file titled "Homelessness_Data_Preparation_Hope_Crosier.ipynb"
