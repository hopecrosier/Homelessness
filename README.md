# Homelessness - Introduction
The purpose of this project is to determine if homelessness can be predicted by local housing market factors. We will focus on market predictors of homelessness and Continuums of Care (CoC) to help get a sense of observations regarding both homelessness and market state in different categories.

## Data
Our data comes from The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and their report "Market Predictors of Homelessness" which can be found here: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/Market-Predictors-of-Homelessness.pdf
It contains data regarding the number of homeless people, along with geographic, demographic and economic factors, which can be found in the files under the Data folder
